My blog post about the whys and wherefores of doing this at : xxxx
TL;DR - If you are playing high circle, a basic roller won't cut it - and you need a roller at high circle far more than low.

This feature list written here to keep me clear on what is going on:

First release:
  VS difficulty removed
    - this is not required in 4th, as the mechanics were re-implemented to be 'every 5 over is an extra success'.
  Steps re-implemented to be separate dice, with display of step
    - the base roller did multiple d12's with modifications. WAT?!
  Karma re-implemented to be variable step, variable amount.
    - Anyone over 3rd circle can put in multiple karma, and spellcasters can alter their karma step. (Talisman Statue EDGM 4e p235)
  Devotion added
    - Questors get some love too.

Later releases:
  Probable average
    - WTF average is step 33 + 4d10 Karma + 1d8 Devotion?
  Different steps of multiple Karma/ Devotion
    - because your buddies might not be the same Karma/ Devotion level as you.
  Graphics
    - each die displayed as a nice little die shape.
  Mid-roll die interruption
    - Cursed karma etc can muck with your roll whilst it rolls.
  Narratively important flag
    - Part of logging. Now you can log whether RNGsus actually hates you.
  Roll logging
    - Now you can check what RNGsus likes/ hates.
  Favourite rolls
    - For common utility rolls that don't change much. Less typing yo.
