Dice roller for Earthdawn 4th Edition.

Earthdawn dice mechanics are a notorious pain in the ass beyond the first few circles.
When you are master tier, they become a mental maths nightmare and slow the game to a complete halt.

This is an attempt to remove a bunch of the complexity and get back to the game.

Forked from : http://sigma.acornscity.com/shadowrun/earthdawn_dice.html
Which is an implementation of rolling using variant d12s.

Note: This uses a pseudo-random number generator.
Unless you are generating cryptographic numbers of rolls, this is mathematically equivalent to rolling your math rocks.

Features:
  Steps rolled on the Earthdawn 4th Edition step table.
  Rolls can be labeled for ease of reference.
  Individual rolls and totals visualised.
  Basic mode adds 1 Karma and/ or 1 Devotion point (at step 4) to a roll.
  Advanced mode allows multiple points of Karma and/ or Devotion at a specified step.

There is still room for improvement - look in the todo file.
